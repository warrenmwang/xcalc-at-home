# Simple Desktop Calculator in C + X11

I felt like I haven't touched C in a long time, so why not try something "simple"
and also learn something new at the same time like how to work with X11 windowing
system on a common Linux OS like Ubuntu, my daily driver. 
> What did I get myself into? X11 is dying in favor of things like Wayland and Hyprland.

## Getting Started

Have an X11 server running. Compile and run program:
```
make && ./main.out
```
